                            Since I was a little kiddo I always liked to keep my hands busy. I was either painting on a wall or just building fake cinematic cameras made out of empty boxes. I’ve always felt comfortable expressing myself and creating stuff. When I grew up I was known as the ‘creative person’ of my class in high school. If anyone wanted something that had to involve creativity, it was me they turned to. Somehow all this background gave me the clarity to determinate that I wanted to enroll a creative program at university, so I started studying Graphic Design because it was the closest program related to the creative field here in El Salvador.

                            Music is so important in my creative process. I get almost all my ideas and motivation thru it. One of the most exciting parts of this process is curating music. I love creating playlists with specific moods and concepts haha. But also, I really enjoy watching movies and finding beauty in oddity and not-so-beauty characters.
