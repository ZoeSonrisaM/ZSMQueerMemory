                        <h2>Marella Moon Albanese is a Western New York born illustrator currently based in Rochester, New York. Their style is reminiscent of editorial illustrations of the fifties and sixties but with a modern edge; drawing inspirations from the counter-cultures that arose around reggae, soul, punk, and androgyny. Above all, their work is people focused, using color and line work to express the importance of each character in different scenarios and settings. Throughout their award winning career, they have been commissioned and published by international clients across the illustration fields of editorial, advertising, product design, and more. Marella is originally from a small farming town in rural Western New York and moved to Brooklyn to pursue their art career after graduating from the Fashion Institute of Technology with a BFA in illustration.</h2>

                            In a lot of my work I use people I’ve sketched from life as my references. I draw a lot of people so I like to go back through my sketchbook and see if there are any “characters” I’m drawn to for an actual illustration piece.
                        </p>

                            I do a lot of self portraits as a form of therapy. I think all of them are very meaningful to me. However, a project from a client that has been meaningful was probably one I did recently about gender affirming care in upstate New York, as it actually helped me find care I personally was looking for.
